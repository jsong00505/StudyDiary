1. repeat the problem
2. assumptions (clarifications)
   1.  constraints
   2.  positive/negative
   3.  empty
   4.  sorted/unsorted
   5.  max/min
3.  exmples
   1.  patterns
   2.  more exmples than interviewer gave
4.  approaches
   1. brain work happening
   2. convincing interviewers
   3. start with naive solution
   4. time/space complexity - trade off
   5. don't get stuck on the deadend
   6. do a BFS and not DFS
 5. talk through everything
   1. ask if it is okay to implement
   2. pseudo-code
   3. less time coding
 6. coding
   1. translate your idea to code
   2. concise value name but you can abbrieviate
   3. modulize your code
   4. know how to use data structure
 7. Test
   1. recursive you have to show in picture
   2. happy path + edge case (if you have more time)
